The aim of this project is to provide travel guide for New Zealand and highlight the **5 biggest cities in New Zealand and what to do there**. This website has been created for my second milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## Overview

New Zealand has become the poster child for how to deal with Covid-19. With the early lockdown and strict border measures mean it has suppressed the virus to an astonishing degree. This also means that there will be highly likely travel restrictions for international travelers, so in the mean time before the travel restrictions will be lifted, this website will allow users to search for holiday destinations in New Zealand. The user can search information about tourist attractions, travel agencies, accommodation, museums, car rentals, restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores near the searched locations.

Furthermore, after completing this project, I would be able to showcase my coding skills and knowledge of the HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript and Intractive Frontend Development modules learnt as part of the Code Instituteâ€™s FullStack Software Development Diploma Course.
