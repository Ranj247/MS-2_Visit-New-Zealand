                        <h3>Auckland</h3>
                        <p>
                            Auckland is a large metropolitan city in the North Island of New Zealand. The most
                            populous urban area in the country, Auckland has an urban population of just under 1.5m. It
                            has the amazing waterfront locations and access to golden sandy beaches or trips out to
                            discover the amazing marine life that also calls Auckland home.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are the top three things to do in Auckland:</p>
                        <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">

                                    <p>
                                        Trip to the top of the iconic Sky Tower is a must on a visit to
                                        Auckland. To make the most of the trip, it's highly recommended to find
                                        a lunchtime special at the Orbit 360 restaurant that will also get you access to
                                        the observation deck too as well as lunch in the revolving restaurant.

                                        Trip to Waiheke Island is a great way to get out and explore
                                        the water on the 40 minute ferry ride before exploring this beautiful island.
                                        From world class vineyards to unique eco-tours, Waiheke Island offers something
                                        for everyone.

                                        close succession about 28,000 years ago. Maungawhau / Mt Eden is one of
                                        Auckland’s most visited maunga (mountain) with over one million visitors each
                                        year. Many walkways lead to the tihi (summit) and spectacular views over the
                                        city and Waitematā Harbour.

                        <h3>Wellington</h3>
                        <p>
                            Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand. It is located at the south-western tip of the
                            North Island, between Cook Strait and the Remutaka Range. It’s a beautiful city to visit
                            with wonderful waterfronts. It is also home to some of New Zealand’s best museums
                            and is the home of the iconic World of WearableArt Show every year.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are the top three things to do in Wellington:</p>

                                    <p>
                                        The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is New Zealand's national museum,
                                        located in Wellington. Aside from the fact that the entry to the museum is
                                        totally FREE, New Zealand’s national museum is the telling of the extraordinary
                                        New Zealand history in the most interactive and fun way possible!

                                        and getting there is part of the fun. Take a trip up the iconic Kelburn Cable
                                        Car which provides great views down over the city and then have fun exploring
                                        the beautiful gardens.

                                        capital city of New Zealand. It is said that Wellington has more restaurants per
                                        head than New York and with rich farmland to the north and the ocean right on
                                        the doorstep, the supply of fresh ingredients makes Wellington a foody’s heaven!

                                        exhibitions. Collection items range from the traditional to the startlingly
                                        contemporary – think light installations and interactive sculptures. Highlights
                                        from New Zealand painters capturing the country's bold landscapes include works

                        <h3>Hamilton</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hamilton is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. Located on the banks of the Waikato
                            River, it is the country's fourth most-populous city. Hamilton is the main city on the
                            region of Waikato. It’s a great place for a stopover on a trip to Raglan, Waitomo or further
                            south to Taupo or Rotorua. The annual hot air balloon festival is always popular as people
                            from all over the country descend on the beautiful city to marvel at the aerial displays.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are the top three things to do in Hamilton:</p>

                            <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

                                    <p>
                                        One of the Waikato region's most visited attractions, Hamilton Gardens hasn't
                                        been developed in the manner of conventional botanic gardens. Instead, it
                                        explores the relationships between people and plants, telling the story of
                                        gardens through different civilisations, in five garden collections that are
                                        spread over 58 hectares.

                                        The Waitomo Caves are 1 hour drive from Hamilton and it’s definitely worth the
                                        trip out. Under the green hills of Waitomo lies a labyrinth of caves, sinkholes
                                        and underground rivers. The area's name comes from the Maori words wai (water)
                                        and tomo (hole). The stunning glowworm caves are homes to millions of tiny
                                        glowworms and it’s a pretty special occasion heading underground to see them all
                                        doing their thing!

                                        it is a delight to hike. It is one of the best places in New Zealand to watch
